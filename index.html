        <h1>Material girl</h1>
        <h3>by Madonna</h3>
        <a>Some boys kiss me<br>
            Some boys hug me<br>
            I think they're ok<br>
            If they don't give me proper credit<br>
            I just walk away<br>
            They can beg and they can plead<br>
            But they can't see the light (that's right)<br>
            'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash<br>
            Is always Mister Right<br>
            'Cause we are living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            Some boys romance<br>
            Some boys slow dance<br>
            That's all right with me<br>
            If they can't raise my interest then I<br>
            Have to let them be<br>
            Some boys try and some boys lie but<br>
            I don't let them play (no way)<br>
            Only boys who save their pennies<br>
            Make my rainy day<br>
            'Cause we're living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            Living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            Living in a material world (material)<br>
            Living in a material world<br>
            Living in a material world (material)<br>
            Living in a material world<br>
            Boys may come and boys may go<br>
            And that's all right you see<br>
            Experience has made me rich<br>
            And now they're after me<br>
            'Cause everybody's living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            Living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br>
            And I am a material girl<br>
            A material, a material, a material, a material world<br>
            Living in a material world (material)<br>
